# Git and GitHub Workflow Practice

## Overview

This repository is for practicing a centralized workflow (clone, commit, push) and an open source workflow (fork, branch, pull request). The README is also practice for clear technical writing.

## What I found interesting

What became interesting to me was the idea that as AI gets better and better at coding, the bottleneck shifts. It’s not about how fast we can churn out lines of code anymore—it’s about the high-level work: planning, reviewing, and coordinating. In that sense, writing code is becoming close to “free”; the real job is making sure the software does what it’s supposed to do and doesn’t break anything else in the process.

I also thought the point about the harness around the model was spot on. Using Codex in a sandbox with restricted network and file access isn’t optional—it’s a necessity. Since these agents can fail in weird ways or get tripped up by bad instructions, giving them a very safe place to experiment without touching production is just smart engineering.

## Comments by Meili Liang

One thing I find especially interesting is the way the article reframes the core bottleneck of software engineering. It’s not saying “AI writes code faster,” which is already familiar—it’s saying that code generation is no longer the hard part. Instead, the real friction is shifting to planning, coordination, review, and long-horizon reasoning. That feels very true to lived developer experience: writing a function is easy; deciding what should exist, where it fits, and how it safely evolves is the real work.
